Some notes about project:

1- Headless or head option is placed in configuration.properties with "headless" key.
   In order to use head or headless you must assign your own Chrome.exe file path in the configuration properties.
   In addition, you may need to update your Chrome browser.

2- I wrote this project with Java compiler 13 Version. When you import the project, you may need to
check your IDE' s compiler settings.

3- In order to run parallel test I added Masterthought Maven-Cucumber-Reporting plugin.
But, when I run the test it throws an error relevant with this plugin. I couldn't fix it.

4- I couldn't create a Docker images.
